***NB: Do not submit your assignment before “Assignment Question Analysis” Class.***


 


Task:


 




Create a `get` route called `/profile` with a required parameter `id`, which will connect to a controller named `ProfileController`. This ProfileController should have only one public method called `index`.




 




The `index` method will receive the `$id` as a route parameter.  Inside the `index` method declare two variables called `$name` and set the value “Donal Trump” and the `$age` value will be “75”. The values of both variables must be in double quotation.




 




Then make a `$data` variable to store the `$id` as well as the declared variables $name and $age as an associative array. The name of the keys will be the same.




 




Also make a cookie; name as `access_token` , value  as `123-XYZ` , minutes as 1, path as ‘/’, domain as $_SERVER[‘SERVER_NAME’], secure as false and httpOnly as true.




 




Return this data as response with status-code `200` and cookie.

   $age = “” ;






//add three variables in $data variable as associative array with values stated in the question


   $data = [

$name = ‘’;


$value = ‘’;


$minutes = ‘’;


$path = ‘’;
